# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Knowledge App's expert mode offline generation is experiencing critical failures that prevent users from generating high-quality questions using local AI models. The system fails during JSON parsing in the enhanced MCQ parser, has issues with DeepSeek model integration, and lacks proper error handling for complex expert-level question generation. These failures result in incomplete quiz generation, poor user experience, and unreliable expert mode functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want expert mode offline generation to work reliably with local AI models, so that I can generate high-quality questions without depending on online services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects expert mode with offline generation THEN the system SHALL successfully initialize the DeepSeek two-model batch pipeline
2. WHEN expert mode generation begins THEN the system SHALL properly handle DeepSeek model responses and parse them correctly
3. WHEN JSON parsing occurs THEN the system SHALL handle malformed responses gracefully and attempt recovery
4. WHEN expert mode generation completes THEN the system SHALL return properly formatted MCQ questions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when expert mode offline generation encounters issues, so that I can understand what's happening and take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JSON parsing fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including the raw response
2. WHEN DeepSeek model responses are malformed THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic correction before failing
3. WHEN expert mode generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with suggested solutions
4. WHEN retries are attempted THEN the system SHALL inform the user of retry attempts and progress

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error handling and recovery mechanisms in expert mode offline generation, so that the system can handle various failure scenarios gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the enhanced MCQ parser encounters invalid JSON THEN it SHALL attempt multiple parsing strategies before failing
2. WHEN DeepSeek model responses contain thinking tokens or extra content THEN the system SHALL clean and extract valid JSON
3. WHEN expert mode generation times out THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
4. WHEN model responses are incomplete THEN the system SHALL request regeneration with modified prompts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want expert mode to leverage the full capabilities of local DeepSeek models, so that I get the highest quality questions possible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN expert mode is selected THEN the system SHALL use the DeepSeek-R1:14B model with optimal GPU utilization
2. WHEN generating expert questions THEN the system SHALL use specialized prompts designed for DeepSeek's reasoning capabilities
3. WHEN DeepSeek generates responses THEN the system SHALL properly handle the model's thinking process and extract final answers
4. WHEN expert mode completes THEN the generated questions SHALL meet PhD-level complexity and accuracy standards

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want expert mode offline generation to be resilient to various model response formats, so that the system works consistently regardless of minor variations in AI output.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DeepSeek returns responses with thinking tags THEN the system SHALL extract clean JSON from the final answer
2. WHEN model responses contain extra whitespace or formatting THEN the system SHALL normalize the content before parsing
3. WHEN JSON contains escaped characters or unicode THEN the system SHALL handle these properly during parsing
4. WHEN responses are truncated or incomplete THEN the system SHALL detect this and request continuation or regeneration
