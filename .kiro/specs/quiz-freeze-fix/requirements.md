# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Knowledge App currently experiences a critical UI freezing issue when users click the "Start Quiz" button. This freezing occurs due to blocking operations being performed on the main UI thread during quiz initialization, including AI model loading, MCQ manager initialization, and question generation. The app becomes completely unresponsive during this process, creating a poor user experience and making the application appear broken.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to remain responsive when I click "Start Quiz", so that I can continue interacting with the interface while the quiz is being prepared.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "Start Quiz" THEN the UI SHALL remain responsive and interactive
2. WHEN quiz initialization begins THEN the system SHALL show immediate visual feedback within 100ms
3. WHEN heavy operations are running THEN the UI SHALL continue to process user interactions
4. WHEN initialization takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide progress updates every 2-3 seconds

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see clear progress indicators during quiz loading, so that I understand the system is working and know what to expect.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quiz initialization starts THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator immediately
2. WHEN different initialization stages occur THEN the system SHALL update the progress message accordingly
3. WHEN initialization takes more than 5 seconds THEN the system SHALL show elapsed time
4. WHEN an error occurs during initialization THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with actionable guidance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the option to cancel quiz loading if it takes too long, so that I can try again or use different settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quiz initialization is in progress THEN the system SHALL provide a cancel button
2. WHEN the user clicks cancel THEN the system SHALL stop all background operations within 2 seconds
3. WHEN cancellation completes THEN the system SHALL return to the previous screen
4. WHEN the user cancels THEN the system SHALL clean up any partially initialized resources

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all heavy operations moved off the main UI thread, so that the application maintains responsiveness under all conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quiz initialization begins THEN all AI model loading SHALL occur in background threads
2. WHEN MCQ manager initialization happens THEN it SHALL not block the UI thread
3. WHEN question generation starts THEN it SHALL use asynchronous processing
4. WHEN any operation takes longer than 50ms THEN it SHALL be moved to a background thread

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the quiz to start as soon as the first question is ready, so that I don't have to wait for all questions to be generated upfront.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the first question is generated THEN the quiz SHALL start immediately
2. WHEN subsequent questions are being generated THEN they SHALL load in the background using pure AI generation
3. WHEN the user answers questions faster than generation THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states
4. WHEN question generation fails THEN the system SHALL retry automatically using the same AI generation method
