# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for converting the existing PyQt5 Knowledge App to a modern React-based web application. The current application is a desktop-based educational platform that generates AI-powered quiz questions using local and cloud AI models. The migration will transform it into a web-based application while preserving all existing functionality and improving user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Application Architecture Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from PyQt5 desktop architecture to React web architecture, so that the application can run in web browsers and be more accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is accessed THEN it SHALL run in modern web browsers without requiring desktop installation
2. WHEN the React app loads THEN it SHALL maintain the same navigation structure (Home, Quiz, Review, Train, Settings)
3. WHEN users interact with the interface THEN it SHALL provide the same responsive experience as the current PyQt5 app
4. WHEN the app initializes THEN it SHALL load within 3 seconds on modern hardware
5. IF the user has Metro bundler installed THEN the development server SHALL start successfully

### Requirement 2: Backend API Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the React app to communicate with the Python backend, so that I can access all AI-powered quiz generation features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the React app needs quiz data THEN it SHALL communicate with Python backend via REST API or WebSocket
2. WHEN quiz generation is requested THEN the backend SHALL process the request using existing MCQ managers
3. WHEN real-time updates are needed THEN the system SHALL use WebSocket connections for live streaming
4. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling and retry mechanisms
5. IF the backend is unavailable THEN the app SHALL display meaningful error messages

### Requirement 3: Quiz Generation Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to generate quizzes with the same options and features, so that I maintain the same learning experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the quiz screen THEN I SHALL see all current options (topic, mode, difficulty, question type, number of questions)
2. WHEN I select "Expert" difficulty THEN the system SHALL use the BatchTwoModelPipeline for PhD-level questions
3. WHEN token streaming is enabled THEN I SHALL see real-time AI thinking process
4. WHEN I start a quiz THEN the system SHALL generate questions using the selected AI model (local/cloud)
5. IF DeepSeek integration is available THEN it SHALL be accessible through the interface

### Requirement 4: Question Review and History

**User Story:** As a user, I want to review my question history in the React app, so that I can track my learning progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to the Review screen THEN I SHALL see all previously generated questions
2. WHEN I search questions THEN the system SHALL filter results by content, topic, or difficulty
3. WHEN I view question statistics THEN I SHALL see total questions, topics covered, and difficulty distribution
4. WHEN I click on a question THEN I SHALL see detailed view with explanation and correct answer
5. IF no questions exist THEN the system SHALL prompt me to generate new questions

### Requirement 5: Training Module Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access model training features, so that I can fine-tune AI models for better question generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the Train screen THEN I SHALL see available models and training options
2. WHEN I upload documents THEN the system SHALL process them using the existing document processor
3. WHEN training starts THEN I SHALL see real-time progress updates
4. WHEN training completes THEN the system SHALL show training metrics and results
5. IF training fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information

### Requirement 6: Settings and Configuration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure API keys and application settings, so that I can customize the app behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access Settings THEN I SHALL see all current configuration options
2. WHEN I enter API keys THEN they SHALL be securely stored and validated
3. WHEN I change theme THEN the interface SHALL update immediately
4. WHEN I modify quiz defaults THEN they SHALL persist across sessions
5. IF API keys are invalid THEN the system SHALL show clear validation errors

### Requirement 7: Real-time Features

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time updates during quiz generation, so that I can see the AI thinking process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN token streaming is enabled THEN I SHALL see tokens appearing in real-time
2. WHEN quiz generation is in progress THEN I SHALL see status updates
3. WHEN using expert mode THEN I SHALL see the two-model pipeline progress
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle reconnection gracefully
5. IF streaming fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to standard generation

### Requirement 8: Responsive Design

**User Story:** As a user, I want the React app to work on different screen sizes, so that I can use it on various devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the app on desktop THEN it SHALL display the full sidebar navigation
2. WHEN I access the app on mobile THEN it SHALL use a collapsible navigation menu
3. WHEN I resize the browser window THEN the layout SHALL adapt smoothly
4. WHEN I use touch devices THEN all interactive elements SHALL be touch-friendly
5. IF the screen is very small THEN the app SHALL maintain usability with appropriate scrolling

### Requirement 9: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the React app to be performant, so that users have a smooth experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN it SHALL achieve First Contentful Paint within 2 seconds
2. WHEN navigating between screens THEN transitions SHALL be smooth without blocking
3. WHEN handling large question lists THEN the app SHALL use virtualization for performance
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL include proper loading states
5. IF memory usage grows THEN the app SHALL implement proper cleanup and garbage collection

### Requirement 10: Development Environment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a proper development setup, so that I can efficiently develop and debug the React app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the development server THEN it SHALL start with hot reloading enabled
2. WHEN I make code changes THEN they SHALL reflect immediately in the browser
3. WHEN debugging is needed THEN proper source maps SHALL be available
4. WHEN building for production THEN the app SHALL be optimized and minified
5. IF Metro is already installed THEN the setup SHALL leverage existing configuration
