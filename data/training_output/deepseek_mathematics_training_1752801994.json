      "question": "If A is a square matrix of order 3 such that all its rows are identical, what is the determinant of A?",

        "B) 1",
        "C) 2",
        "D) 3"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "A) 0",
      "explanation": "If a square matrix has all its rows (or columns) identical, it means the rows are linearly dependent. A determinant of such a matrix is always zero because the matrix is singular and not invertible.",
