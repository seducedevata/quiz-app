As LLMs have become integral to both\nresearch and daily operations, rigorous evaluation is crucial. This assessment is\nimportant not only for individual tasks but also for understanding their societal\nimpact and potential risks. Despite extensive efforts to examine LLMs from var-\nious perspectives, there is a noticeable lack of multi-agent AI models specifically\ndesigned to evaluate the performance",
