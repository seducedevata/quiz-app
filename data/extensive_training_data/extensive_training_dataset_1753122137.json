        "A) To determine the validity of a research design",
        "B) To assess the effectiveness of interventions",
        "C) To evaluate the relationship between variables",
        "D) All of the above"

      "question": "Which methodology is considered a state-of-the-art approach for evaluating code generation using large language models?",
      "options": [
        "A) Manual code review by developers",
        "B) Using automated metrics like BLEU or ROUGE",
        "C) Large Language Models as evaluators",
        "D) Crowdsourcing evaluations with human annotators"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "According to the research, Terry Yue Zhuo (2023) highlights that large language models (LLMs) are state-of-the-art evaluators for code generation. This approach leverages the inherent understanding of code structure and semantics within LLMs to assess generated code more effectively than traditional metrics which may not capture nuances in programming languages.",

      "question": "In multi-agent systems for software development, what role does each agent typically play?",
      "options": [
        "A) Each agent independently solves a specific problem without coordination",
        "B) Agents collaborate to cover different aspects of the software development lifecycle",
        "C) Agents compete against each other to improve system performance",
        "D) Agents function as part of a single integrated system with no distinct roles"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The research by Rasheed et al. (2024a, 2024b) discusses the use of multi-agent systems where each agent is specialized for specific tasks within software development, such as code analysis or testing, allowing them to collaborate effectively across different stages of the SDLC.",

        "A) The lack of pre-trained models dedicated to programming languages",
        "B) The difficulty in handling domain-specific jargon and syntax in code",

        "D) The scalability issues with large language models"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Rafael-Michael Karampatsis et al. (2020) address the challenge that open-vocabulary models help overcome by better handling domain-specific jargon and syntax in source code, which traditional closed vocabulary models struggle with.",
