            Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.
            It is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) based on the idea that systems can learn from data,
            identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
            
            Example 1: Linear Regression
            The formula for linear regression is: y = mx + b
            Where:
            - y is the dependent variable
            - x is the independent variable  
            - m is the slope
            - b is the y-intercept
            
            Problem 1: Calculate the equation
            Given points (1,2) and (3,6), find the linear equation.
            
            Solution:
            Slope m = (6-2)/(3-1) = 4/2 = 2
            Using point (1,2): 2 = 2(1) + b, so b = 0
            Therefore: y = 2x
