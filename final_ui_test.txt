Final UI Test Document

This is a test document to verify that both upload and delete functionality work correctly in the Knowledge App UI.

Chapter 1: Testing Upload
When this file is uploaded via the UI (drag & drop or browse button), it should:
- Be converted to base64 by the JavaScript
- Be sent to the Python backend via uploadFile() method
- Be saved to both data/uploaded_books/ and uploaded_books/ directories
- Appear in the file list in the Training tab
- Be available for the enhanced training pipeline

Chapter 2: Testing Delete
When this file is deleted via the UI (clicking the Ã— button), it should:
- Call the removeFile() JavaScript function
- Send a delete request to the Python backend via deleteUploadedFile() method
- Be removed from both storage directories
- Disappear from the file list in the Training tab
- Update the UI immediately to reflect the change

Chapter 3: Integration Testing
Both upload and delete should work together without interfering with each other:
- Upload should work after delete operations
- Delete should work after upload operations
- File list should always be accurate and up-to-date
- No stale data should remain in the UI

This document serves as a comprehensive test case for the complete upload and delete workflow in the Knowledge App.
