Correct: A
Explanation: "Using E = hc/Œª = (4.14√ó10‚Åª¬π‚Åµ eV¬∑s)(3√ó10‚Å∏ m/s)/(500√ó10‚Åª‚Åπ m) = 2.48 eV"

    """

Example 1:
Question: "Why does the photoelectric effect demonstrate the particle nature of light?"
Options: 
A) Light exhibits wave interference patterns
B) Photon energy depends only on frequency, not intensity
C) Light can be diffracted around obstacles  
D) Light travels at constant speed in vacuum
Correct: B
Explanation: "The photoelectric effect shows that increasing light intensity doesn't increase electron kinetic energy, only frequency does, proving light consists of discrete photon particles."

Example 2:
Question: "How does quantum tunneling allow particles to pass through energy barriers?"
Options:
A) Particles gain enough thermal energy to overcome the barrier
B) Wave function probability extends beyond the barrier
C) Particles are accelerated by electric fields
D) The barrier height decreases over time
Correct: B
Explanation: "In quantum mechanics, the wave function has non-zero probability beyond barriers, allowing particles to 'tunnel' through classically forbidden regions."
