Chapter 1: Introduction to Physics
Physics is the fundamental science that seeks to understand how the universe works. It deals with matter, energy, motion, forces, space, and time.

Key Concepts:
- Matter and Energy
- Motion and Forces
- Space and Time
- Conservation Laws

Chapter 2: Quantum Mechanics
Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scale.

Important Principles:
- Wave-particle duality
- Uncertainty principle
- Quantum superposition
- Quantum entanglement

Chapter 3: Thermodynamics
Thermodynamics is the branch of physics that deals with heat, work, and temperature, and their relation to energy, radiation, and physical properties of matter.

Laws of Thermodynamics:
1. First Law: Energy cannot be created or destroyed
2. Second Law: Entropy of an isolated system always increases
3. Third Law: Entropy approaches zero as temperature approaches absolute zero

Chapter 4: Electromagnetism
Electromagnetism is a branch of physics involving the study of the electromagnetic force, a type of physical interaction that occurs between electrically charged particles.

Maxwell's Equations:
- Gauss's law for electricity
- Gauss's law for magnetism
- Faraday's law of induction
- Amp√®re's law with Maxwell's addition
