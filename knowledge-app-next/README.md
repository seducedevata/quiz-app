# Knowledge App Next.js Frontend

This is the Next.js frontend for the Knowledge App, designed to replace the Qt WebEngine UI. It provides a modern, responsive, and interactive user interface for the application.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run the development server:

1. Navigate to the `knowledge-app-next` directory:
   ```bash
   cd knowledge-app-next
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the Next.js development server and the API bridge. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Connect to Python backend (Flask bridge)

The frontend talks to the Python bridge at `NEXT_PUBLIC_PYTHON_BRIDGE_URL` (default `http://localhost:8000`).

1) Ensure Python bridge deps are installed:
    - From the `knowledge-app-next` folder run:
       - Windows PowerShell:
          ```powershell
          pip install -r api-server/requirements.txt
          ```

2) Start both servers in dev:
    - Next.js + bridge (concurrently) via:
       ```powershell
       npm run dev
       ```
    - Or start bridge only:
       ```powershell
       python api-server/bridge-server.py
       ```

3) Verify health:
    - Frontend proxy: http://localhost:3000/health
    - Bridge direct:  http://localhost:8000/health
